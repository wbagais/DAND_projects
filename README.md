# DAND_projects
Here I upload my projects from data analysis nano degree from  Udacity

## project #1: (python)
Bike share analysis
Using python I compared the useage of bicycle-sharing system in New York, Chicago, and Qashington
The data provided by Motivate. 

## project #2: (python)
Investigate tmdb-movies Dataset
tmdb movies dataset contain information about the movies from the mid-60s till 2015. Here I will answer below questions. In my analysis I will compare the data based on the segment of 5 years: 70-74 -- 75-79 -- 80-84 -- 85-89 -- 90-94 -- 95-99 -- 2000-2004 -- 2005-2009 -- 2010-2015 I will ignore the 60s since we only have data starting from 66.

How many movies in each segment?
What is the relationship between revenue and budget?
What is the relationship between revenue and runtime?
What is most produced genre in each generation?

## project #3: (python)
Analyze A/B Test Results
This project is divided into 3 sections:
Part I - Probability
Part II - A/B Test
Part III - A regression approach

## project #4: (python)
Test a Perceptual Phenomenon
Analyzing the Stroop Effect Using the t test and A/B test.

## project #5: (R)
This report contains red wines data with 11 variables for red wine chemical properties and one variable for expert quality rating between 0 (very bad) and 10 (very excellent). Using this data, I will try to find which chemical properties influence the quality of red wines?
This project is divided into 5 sections: 
1 - Univariate Plots Section and analysis section
2 - Bivariate Plots Section and analysis section
3 - Multivariate Plots Section and analysis section
4 - Final Plots and Summar 
5 - Reflection
The source of the red wine data:
